Phase 1: Project Setup and Architecture Overview
Before diving into code, let's establish a solid foundation. This e-commerce platform for oversized gym clothes (e.g., hoodies, joggers, tanks in loose fits for men/women) will follow a hybrid architecture combining MVC (for structured web app flows) and Microservices (for scalable components like payments, notifications, and user management). This ensures maintainability, scalability, and adherence to good design patterns like Repository, Unit of Work, Dependency Injection, and CQRS for complex queries.
High-Level Architecture

Backend: ASP.NET Core 8.0 (latest stable as of 2025) for APIs and MVC controllers. Microservices for:

User Service (auth, roles: Visitor, Customer, Seller, Admin).
Product Service (catalog, search/filter).
Order Service (cart, wishlist, checkout, history).
Payment Service (Mercado Pago integration, cards/debit).
Notification Service (emails, in-app alerts).


Frontend: React 18+ with Tailwind CSS for responsive, beautiful UI (mobile-first, clean gym-inspired design: bold colors, oversized imagery).
Database: PostgreSQL (via Entity Framework Core) with tables for Users, Products, Orders, Carts, Wishlists, etc. Hosted on Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
Auth: ASP.NET Identity with JWT for sessions, plus OAuth2 for Google/Microsoft login.
Hosting: Azure App Service for backend, Azure Static Web Apps for frontend, Azure Functions for lightweight microservices if needed.
Patterns:

Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access.
Unit of Work: Manages transactions across repositories.
Dependency Injection: Built-in in ASP.NET.
Middleware: For auth, error handling, logging.
CRUD: Via API endpoints with DTOs for security.


Tools/Dependencies:

Backend: .NET SDK 8.0, EF Core, Npgsql (PostgreSQL driver), AutoMapper, Swashbuckle (Swagger for API docs).
Frontend: Vite for build, Axios for API calls, React Router, Zustand for state (cart/wishlist).
Other: Azure SDK for deployment, Nodemailer/SendGrid for emails, Mercado Pago SDK.



Development Process Overview
We'll build iteratively:

Setup: Solution structure, DB schema.
Backend Core: Auth, User Management.
Product Catalog Service.
Order & Cart Management.
Payment Integration.
Notifications & Extras.
Frontend Integration.
Deployment & Testing.

Each phase includes:

Explanation: Why/how it fits requirements.
Step-by-Step Build: Commands, code files.
Integration: How it connects to prior/next parts.
Documentation: Inline comments, structure diagrams.

Prerequisites:

Install .NET 8.0 SDK: winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8 (Windows) or brew install --cask dotnet-sdk (macOS).
Node.js 20+: For React.
PostgreSQL: Local via Docker (docker run --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Password123 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres), or Azure.
Visual Studio 2022+ or VS Code with C# extension.
Azure account (free tier for prototyping).
